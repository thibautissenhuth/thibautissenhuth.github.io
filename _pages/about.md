I am a researcher in deep generative models at [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com/). I completed my PhD in 2023 in collaboration with [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com/) and [Imagine Lab](https://imagine-lab.enpc.fr/), Ecole des Ponts ParisTech. I was advised by Jérémie Mary (Criteo) and David Picard (ENPC).

<strong>Research interest.</strong> My research focuses on the use of deep generative models on high-dimensional data, particularly on natural images. I am interested in both the theoretical understanding and the potential applications of these models. My main contributions concern improving and understanding Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on multi-modal and disconnected data distributions, and deep neural networks for image editing.
